# Automate_Notion_Tasks

**Created:** 2022  
**Author:** Mubarak Albishri  

## Overview
This project was built in 2022 to make my life easier and save time.  
The main idea is simple — automate repetitive tasks in Notion.

There are two main parts to it:
1. **Automatic Event Renaming:** rename events using a predefined pattern.
2. **Event Shifting:** move events across the week automatically to free up space and avoid duplication.

## Why I Built It
At the time, I was spending too much time manually updating Notion events — renaming, copying, and shifting them around.  
This project fixed that. It automated the boring stuff so I could focus on actual work.

## How It Works
- Connects to the Notion API.
- Fetches specific events or database items.
- Applies a renaming pattern (customizable).
- Shifts events throughout the week automatically.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python  
- **API:** Notion API  
- **Purpose:** Task automation / event scheduling

## Possible Improvements
- Add a simple CLI or GUI for configuration.  
- Support multiple Notion workspaces.  
- Add logging and scheduling for background execution.
